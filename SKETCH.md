# Background

We live in a house built in the 1930s which has a useless tile stove left in the dining room. It is connected with the basement - there used to be a coal-powered iron stove underneath. It looks nice but it doesn't provide any function and takes a lot of space.

# Idea

I want to preserve the tile stove but add some feature to it. I got the idea to install a *[paternoster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paternoster_lift)*-like rotating shelf in it to store a selection of wines in the dark, cool basement and deliver them to the dining room on demand.
